    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

Here we see that our simple linear regression model explains over 80% of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set. Clearly you are onto something, although the much lower value for the test set suggests you're overfitting somewhat. This isn't a surprise as you've made no effort to select a parsimonious set of features or deal with multicollinearity in our data."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training.

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "\n",
    "In this stage of data preprocessing and training, we loaded the prepared dataset (ski_data_step3_features) from the previous stage. This dataset includes all original and created features based on state data, such as per capita and per square mile ratios, totaling 36 features. We performed the following operations to create our best model at this stage:\n",
    "- Big Mountain data was excluded from the dataset to enable the model to learn from other available data. The Big Mountain data will be utilized later when the model is applied for results.\n",
    "- The data was divided, reserving 30% for testing. The 'Adultweekend' column is used as the dependent variable (y), and the remaining columns are used as independent variables (X).\n",
    "- The mean value of y was calculated. Metrics used in the exercise to evaluate our models include R squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "- The first model employed was sklearn's DummyRegressor, which calculates only the mean value of the target variable. This serves as a placebo control group similar to medical research. We will evaluate all subsequent models based on the results of this model to assess performance. Results: R squared with test data = -0.003, MAE with test data = 19.136.\n",
    "- Subsequently, we applied StandardScaler to standardize our dataset due to significant variation across the features.\n",
    "- The first model we used was LinearRegression on scaled data, which improved the R squared to 0.720 and reduced the MAE on test data to 9.407.\n",
    "- We then explored using pipelines in SKlearn with the following components: SimpleImputer (fills NA values with the median), StandardScaler, and LinearRegression. This resulted in the same outcome as the standalone LinearRegression model.\n",
    "- Further refinement was achieved using SelectKBest to reduce the feature set. SelectKBest identifies the most important K features that maintain data integrity without causing overfitting. Results: R squared = 0.625, MAE = 11.201.\n",
    "- Refining SelectKBest with K value set to 15 yielded R squared = 0.637, MAE = 10.488.\n",
    "- Cross-validation was performed to optimize model parameters. Cross-validation divides the data into several folds and performs training and testing multiple times for robust results. By default, the test_score is the R squared score. With CV=5, it produced five scores. Mean R squared score = 0.632.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using GridSearchCV to identify the best values for K in SelectKBest. The optimal K value was determined to be 8.\n",
    "- The next model applied was RandomForestRegressor. Using GridSearchCV with various grid parameters, including different numbers of trees, StandardScaler on/off, and mean/median imputer strategies, we identified the best parameters for model building.\n",
    "- Final Model with LinearRegression: MAE = 11.793\n",
    "- Final Model with RandomForestRegressor: MAE = 9.537\n",
    "- Conclusion: The random forest model has a lower cross-validation mean absolute error by nearly $1 and demonstrates less variability. Performance verification on the test set confirmed consistency with the cross-validation results.\n"
